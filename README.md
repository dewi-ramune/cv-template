# cv-template

Free to use resume template. I can't guarantee you will get jobs from it.  
I haven't put much effort into the code quality, but it should be pretty easy to use.

## Design

The CV has been set to A4 dimensions (`width: 794px / height: 1122px`) and page margins have been removed so it can be saved as a PDF in Chrome with custom margins.
